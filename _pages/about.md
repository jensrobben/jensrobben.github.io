Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://rclr.nl/">Research Centre for Longevity Risk</a> of the University of Amsterdam. Previously, I did my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://katrienantonio.github.io">Katrien Antonio</a> in the Insurance department at the Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven. My current research explores diverse aspects of mortality and longevity modeling, with a focus on the impact of environmental and epidemiological variables on excess mortality, the use of machine learning techniques in mortality modeling, and old-age mortality patterns. Additionally, I hold a keen interest in the application of data science techniques within the non-life insurance domain.
