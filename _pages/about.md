Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://rclr.nl/">Research Centre for Longevity Risk</a> of the University of Amsterdam. My current research explores diverse aspects of mortality and longevity modeling, with a focus on the impact of environmental and epidemiological variables on excess mortality, the use of machine learning techniques in mortality modeling, and old-age mortality patterns. Additionally, I hold a keen interest in the application of data science techniques within the non-life insurance domain.

## News
<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Together with Andrew Cairns (Heriot-Watt University) and Torsten Kleinow (University of Amsterdam), I received a research grant funded by the Life Section of the International Actuarial Association for our project "<i>A Machine Learning Approach to Constructing a Socio-Economic Heat Vulnerability Index Using Individual-Level Mortality Data</i>".

<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Starting September, I will be a guest lecturer for part of the courses <a href="https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/D0R33AE.htm">Loss Models</a> and <a href= "https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/D0N56AE.htm">Advanced Life Insurance Mathematics</a> at KU Leuven.

<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Our paper "<i>The short-term association between environmental variables and mortality: evidence from Europe </i>", co-authored with Katrien Antonio and Torsten Kleinow, has been published in the <b>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A</b>. You can read it <a href="
https://academic.oup.com/jrsssa/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jrsssa/qnaf052/8142302">here</a>.

<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Our new working paper, co-authored with Karim Barigou (UCLouvain) and Torsten Kleinow (UvA), is now available: "<i>Granular mortality modeling with temperature and epidemic shocks: a three-state regime-switching approach
</i>". You can read it on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04568">arXiv</a>.

<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> As of September 1, 2024 I have started as a postdoctoral researcher at the Research Centre for Longevity Risk of the University of Amsterdam.
