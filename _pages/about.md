Welcome! I'm a fourth-year PhD researcher under the supervision of <a href="https://katrien.antonio.github.io">Katrien Antonio</a> in the Insurance department at the Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven. My current research explores diverse aspects of mortality modeling, with a focus on multi-population mortality projection models and the application of machine learning techniques to mortality modelling. Additionally, I hold a keen interest in the application of data science techniques within the non-life insurance domain.
